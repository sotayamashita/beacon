## Project Overview
<!-- LLM Instructions: Update @specs/project.md when you change this section -->

**Beacon** is a lightweight, high-performance status line generator written in Rust, designed for AI-powered development environments. It provides a starship-like configuration experience.

## Development

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by [Starship](https://starship.rs/), the excellent cross-shell prompt. I've adapted its modular architecture for Claude Code's statusline.
